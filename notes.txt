Plugin Notes:

::FONT::
This plugin needs a special font to work properly. A font in which each character has the same width is needed. There are plenty of fonts to choose, like every monospaced font for example, here is a common list:
- Droid Sans Mono
- Consolas
- Menlo
- Monaco
- Lucida Console
- Liberation Mono
- DejaVu Sans Mono
- Bitstream Vera Sans Mono
- Courier New
- monospace
- serif

I choose Droid Sans Mono for this plugin, in the provided sample I use "Droid Sans Mono" from google fonts, to use it you need to add this at the head tag in your html:
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Droid+Sans+Mono" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">

If you want to use another font, you need to add the selected font and change the css styles fo the plugin referencing that font.

::Icons/Buttons::
There are to buttons added, a play/pause button and a close button in form of an "a" tag.
But there's no images or icons provided, instead of using an image I use FontAwesome to get a good scalable and vector icons. That put another requierement in you html, you need to add a reference to fontawesome like this:
<link href="http://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.1.0/css/font-awesome.min.css" rel="stylesheet">

Of course, if you don't want to use fontawesome you can use icons or image instead by modifing the styles of the plugin.
I can provided an "iconed" version of the plugin avoiding the use of fontawesome if needed.
